#  Real-Time Password Strength Checker using Python

This project is a web-based password strength checker that provides real-time feedback on password strength, including an estimation of how long it would take to crack the password using a brute force attack, along with user-friendly suggestions and educational content. The Web Application UI was created using HTML and CSS with the help of AI

## Features

- Real-time password strength evaluation
- Visual strength meter
- Detailed feedback on how to improve password strength
- Estimated time to crack the password
- User-friendly suggestions for password improvement
- Generation of strong password examples
- Educational tooltips on password best practices
- Dark-themed, responsive user interface

## How It Works

### Backend (app.py)

The backend is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Here's how it functions:

1. **Password Strength Checking**: 
   - The `check_password_strength()` function evaluates the password based on several criteria:
     - Length
     - Presence of uppercase letters
     - Presence of lowercase letters
     - Presence of numbers
     - Presence of special characters
   - It assigns a strength rating (Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong) based on these criteria.
   - It also generates feedback on how to improve the password.

2. **Cracking Time Estimation**:
   - The `estimate_cracking_time()` function calculates an estimated time to crack the password using a brute force attack.
   - It considers the character set used in the password and the password length.
   - The estimation assumes a rate of 1 billion guesses per second.

3. **Improvement Tips**:
   - The `get_password_improvement_tips()` function generates specific tips based on what the current password is lacking (e.g., "Add uppercase letters" if there are none).

4. **Strong Password Generation**:
   - The `generate_strong_password()` function creates a random strong password as an example for the user.

5. **API Endpoint**:
   - The `/check_password` route accepts POST requests with the password.
   - It returns a JSON response with the strength rating, feedback, estimated cracking time, improvement tips, and a strong password suggestion.
